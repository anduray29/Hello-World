# Hello-World
Initiation to GitHub
Hello, I am an HRIS Systems Analyst who is trying to break into the world of Programming. My work requires me to think of a system from a User perspective. Therefore, i get to design pages that will not only look appealing to users but will also be easy to navigate, and will meet the needs of our Users. Although, I enjoy my work, often times I am left wondering how and what our programmers did to make a page work the way it does, or how did they create something from scratch. I am ready to start this new journey!
